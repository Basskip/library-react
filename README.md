# JavaScript Library App in React

A project from [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/frameworks) curriculum, recreating my previous [Library App](https://github.com/Basskip/top-library) but this time in react

## Things I learned
* How to quickly create a React app using [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/)
* React basics - from [30 days react](https://www.newline.co/fullstack-react/30-days-of-react/)
* Using lifecycle hooks in React
* How to deploy a React app to GitHub pages - from [this article](https://dev.to/yuribenjamin/how-to-deploy-react-app-in-github-pages-2a1f)

## Things to work on
* Could add some form validations (pages must be greater than 0 etc.)
